=============================================================================
							ASA ASSIGNMENT
	Preliminaries:

	Look at the Rect and Drifter functions to understand how we are going to be doing
	object-oriented programming for this assignment

	The Start of the program happens at the start function (above^)
	It creates instances of our class and pushes them to an entities list

	window.requestAnimationFrame(step);
		This line starts the looping in the step function (found at the beginning of the program)
		It will automatically go through every entity in entities
		to call its update function and its draw function

	All you have to worry about is making the classes and pushing instances of them to entities in start
	I have shown some examples of how to instantiate objects of the classes in different ways
	Notice how the use of parameters is very flexible,
	you may want to look into the code behind this in Rect that uses the || (OR operator)
		Figure out what the following code does and how it is used
				(remember you can use chrome's console as a shell):
			var a = true||false;
			var b = 3||4;
			var c = false||10;
			var d; //this is undefined
			var e = d||10; //what does this do?
			var f = d||0;


	ASIGNMENT:

	You can do this however you want as long as it works. You don't know how to use inheritence with this style,
		so for now simlar functionalities can just be copied from the code of other classes
			You can just copy the code for Rect to begin the code for Drifter for now
	
	LEVEL1:

	Finish the Drifter class to behave like a Rect but with a velocity in x and y (vx, vy)
		Every frame (update) 
			it's x will increase by vx
			it's y will increase by vy
		Make sure that these attributes can be set through the parameters
		Make sure that it works when no parameters are given (use whatever default values you want)

	Create a Looper class that will behave exactly like Drifter but 
		when it drifts out of bounds (off screen) it will loop to the other side

	Add some Looper objects in start
	




	LEVEL2:

	Create a MouseMove class that will move towards the mouse
		You can access the mouse coordinates using the mouse variable I have set up
		You can do this in any way as long as the object moves closer to the mouse and will eventually reach it

	Create a MousePointer class
		its position will always be the midpoint between the mouse position and the center of the screen

	Create a MousePath class that will move towards the mouse but 
		it will move directly towards it
		with a constant set speed
	




	
	LEVEL3:

	Create a LinePath class
		it will move back in forth between two points in space that you can set

	Create a CirlcePath class 
		it will move in a circle a set distance away from a center point
		You may need to recall the unit circle and its relation to trig
		you may need to look up certain Math functions for js

	Create a SquarePath class
		it will move in a square path of a set size from a center point
